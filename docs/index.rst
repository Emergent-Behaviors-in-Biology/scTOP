Single-cell Type Order Parameters: identifying cell phenotype from gene expression data
=========================================================================================

A package for finding projections onto known cell phenotyes, given matrices of raw RNA count data. 
The theoretical background for this project can be found in `Epigenetic Landscapes Explain Partially Reprogrammed Cells and Identify Key Reprogramming Genes <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003734>`_ by Alex H. Lang, Hu Li, James J. Collins, and Pankaj Mehta. 

A manuscript detailing the technical details of applying our method to single-cell RNA-seq is in progress, hopefully to be completed Summer 2022.
